1      abc       20      male     - Row			Document

Students - Collection
Data as JSON (BSON)
1 collection will have many documents
[
{sno:1,sname:"abc",sage:20,sgender:"male"},
{sno:2,sname:"def",sage:21,sgender:"female"},
{sno:3,sname:"ghi",sage:22,sgender:"male"},
{sno:4,sname:"jkl",sage:23,sgender:"female"}
]


Features of MongoDB
Store data in a collection as a document. Each document will have an unique key -----  "_id" auto generated by mdb for each doc, or we can also create our own _id.

free, flexible. sharding, indexing, db solution

MDB stores data like Number, String, Boolean, array, nested Objects(Embedded docs), ObjectId, Timestamps

1. Install MongoDB Driver (MongoD) to connect to Mongo Db server and create local Databases in your computer.
Eg: Xampp Server -- To connect with MySQL Database and create our own local db in our computer

2. Learn mongodb commands using mongo shell (Install Mongosh - Command Line interface thats used to type mongodb commands and interacts with local DB and remoteDB )

3. Sign up to MongoDB Atlas - used to create Remote DB - for Mobility

4. Install MongoDB Compass (Interactive GUI - to view and use the local and remote DB)
Eg: MYSQL Workbench

5. Learn how to connect Remote DB & Local DB -- Shell, Compass, VSC


MongoD  ---- Xampp - helps our computer to connect to the db server
MongoSh --- Black Shell - helps to type query or command
MongoDBCompass - Workbench - gives ui to easily work with db
MongoDBAtlas - PHPMyAdmin - gives online support to work with cloud db

we can create databases in computer(sh,compass) or in cloud(atlas)-sh,compass

Connect MDB(L+R) with Shell, Compass, VSC

---------

show dbs; - shows databases with some size of info, not show db which is empty
show collections; - shows the collections available in a db
use db_name; - switches the control to a particular db, if we give a non existing db name, that db will be created for us
db.createCollection("colln name"); - create a new collection in a particular database

--------------------------------
1. create collections in other ways
2. insert , update, delete, select docs
	- json,bson
	-CRUD with nested docs, arrays
3. aggregation
4. projections
5. cursors
6. connect local and remote db to shell,compass and vsc
