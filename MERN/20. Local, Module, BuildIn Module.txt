LOCAL MODULE:

2. Using ESModules Standard - React, Angular - Works on basis of modern js - file should have .mjs as an extension - mjs an extension for EcmaScript modules
pattern1:
use export default to share a data, use import data from 'file-path' to recieve a data from diff file
Error: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
Clear this error by keeping file extension as .mjs, run using node filename.mjs, import using './filename.mjs'
pattern1.1:
use export var to share a data, use import {data} from 'file-path' to recieve a data from diff file
pattern2:
if there is more than one data to be shared, pack them as objects - with different keys. use parent.key to retrieve the value - and then manipulate the value
pattern3:
if there is more data, we share as objects, make key and value name similar, so that yu can write only once - SHORTER SYNTAX PROPERTY OF OBJECT LITERAL. use parent.key to retrieve the value - and then manipulate the value
pattern4:
while getting the obj from a file, destructure it to avoid parent name and dot operator
pattern5:
if we are individually exporting data or function, while importing directly- {}, use same name as exported
pattern6:
if we are individually exporting data or function, while importing them as * (All) - use alias name to grab everything - destructure it and use it
